# Recon2Neo4j

The EpiGeNet framework is a graph database for storage and querying of conditional relationships between molecular (genetic and epigenetic) events observed at different stages of colorectal (CRC) oncogenesis. Data were i) extracted from <a href="http://statepigen.sci-sym.dcu.ie/index.php">StatEpigen</a>, a manually curated and annotated database, containing information on interdependencies between genetic and epigenetic signals, and specialized currently for CRC research, and ii) imported to our newly-developed EpiGeNet, which offers improved capability for management and visualization of data on molecular events specific to CRC initiation and progression

## How to access the EpiGeNet Framework
The EpiGeNet Framework can be accessed online <a href="https://diseaseknowledgebase.etriks.org/epigenet/browser/"> here</a>

A non-exhaustive file with Cypher query examples for the EpiGeNet Framework is available for download <a href="epigenet_framework_sample_queries.docx" download="epigenet_framework_sample_queries.docx"> here</a>.
	
### For developers
The EpiGeNet Framework is freely available for non-commercial purposes and the java code used for data integration and mapping into the  framework is available <a href="https://github.com/ibalaur/EpiGeNet">here</a>.<br><br>
